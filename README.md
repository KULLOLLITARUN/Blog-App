Developed a full-stack blog platform that allows users to register, create, view, and manage blog posts across multiple categories such as Programming, Cooking, Workouts, and more. The frontend was built using React with dynamic routing and responsive UI. The backend was developed with Node.js and Express, handling authentication, CRUD operations for blog posts, and user management. MySQL was used as the relational database to store user data and blog content. The application supports filtering blogs by category, dedicated post view pages, and seamless switching between mock data and real-time API data from the backend. The project also features image rendering based on categories, form validations, and modular React components.

Key Features:

* User registration and login system (if applicable)
* Blog creation form with category selection and validations
* Fetching blogs from both mock data and live database (merged display)
* Category-based blog filtering and dynamic URL routing
* RESTful APIs to handle post creation, reading, filtering by category and ID
* Used useState, useEffect, useParams, and Context APIs for frontend state and routing
* Images dynamically rendered based on blog category
* Backend validations and error handling for database operations
* Fully modular and reusable React component architecture
